== health check aspects

=== built-in
Basic healthcheck in Dockerfile. Docker eval curl connection to torproject site and get own type of connection.

Another kind of self-chek via stdout logs: `tor/run` script have shedulled task. It get current "exit" ip addres. You should know your current ip addres from provider to see the difference. Below are a lot of variants to get it.

=== Python

The https://stem.torproject.org/[stem] package exposes functionality for interacting with the Tor controller interface.

```bash
pip3 install stem
```

Use the requests package to send requests via the Tor proxies.

```python
>>> import requests
>>> requests.get("http://httpbin.org/ip").json()
{'origin': '105.224.106.150'}
>>> requests.get("http://httpbin.org/ip", proxies={"http": "http://127.0.0.1:8888"}).json()
{'origin': '185.220.102.4'}
>>> requests.get("http://httpbin.org/ip", proxies={"http": "socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"}).json()
{'origin': '185.100.87.206'}
```

This assumes that you've installed the `requests` module with support for SOCKS5.

```bash
pip3 install -U requests[socks]
```

=== R lang

```r
> library(httr)
> GET("http://httpbin.org/ip")
{
  "origin": "105.224.106.150"
}
> GET("http://httpbin.org/ip", use_proxy("http://127.0.0.1:8888"))
{
  "origin": "185.220.102.4"
}
> GET("http://httpbin.org/ip", use_proxy("socks5://127.0.0.1:9050"))
{
  "origin": "185.100.87.206"
}
```
